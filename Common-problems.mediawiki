== nothing happens ==

# Does your database includes the "delayed_job" table ? If not, go through installation instructions again.
# Start your app with no workers and check if jobs are added in the database. If not, see "No jobs are added in the database"
# If jobs are present, then launch manually one worker : "rake jobs". Jobs should be processed and disappear from the database.
## If jobs are still here, do they show an error ? If yes, see "jobs show an error".
## If jobs are no longer in the database, they were processed. See log/delayed_job

== No jobs are added in the database ==
Assuming the delayed_job table is here, try to inspect the logs (log/developpement.log). Do you use protection against mass assignment ? If yes, you should relax the rules for two fields :
 ActiveRecord::Base.send(:attr_accessible, :priority)
 ActiveRecord::Base.send(:attr_accessible, :payload_object)
Just like you probably did for the sessions, cf. http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=32634

== jobs show an error ==
=== undefined method 'xxx' for class... ===
First just check if the given class has the method (never know !)
Then, look closely at the 'handler' field of the job. It should be something like that (action mailer example)
 --- !ruby/struct:Delayed::PerformableMailer 
 object: !ruby/class TestMailer
 method_name: :test_email
 args: 
 - xxx@gmail.com
And NOT like that :
 --- !ruby/struct:Delayed::PerformableMailer 
 object: !ruby/object:Class TestMailer
 method_name: :test_email
 args: 
 - xxx@gmail.com
See the difference ? The second one happen when you use the 'thin' server instead of the classic mongrel ('rails server'). I don't know why. For now, the solution is to use 'rails server'.
