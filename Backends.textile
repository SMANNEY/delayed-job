delayed_job allows you to use whatever data store you want for the job queue. Here are the current backends:

* "DataMapper":http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job_data_mapper
* "Mongoid":http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job_mongoid

It's really easy to make delayed_job work with your preferred data store. Just copy one of the existing ones, and implement @Delayed::Backend::[YourBackendName]::Job@.
